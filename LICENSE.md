Adapted from VVVVVV's source code license. This is NOT an Open Source license (though it's still fairly free) - read for details. If you think something ought to be changed reach out to Melos Han-Tani at hello@analgesic.productions

- Summary of license: You must own the paid game to use the game assets, but the code is open to everyone. If you're doing noncommercial or commercial things with a low budget ( < $100k), you can do anything, so long as you credit us. Don't sell anything unaltered (don't sell our sprites or music unaltered, or compile and try to sell the game unaltered.)

If you are interested in distributing work that falls outside the terms in the license below, or if you are interested in distributing work that includes using any part of Anodyne not included in this repo then please get in touch - we can discuss granting a license for that on a case by case basis.

Anodyne License v1.0.5
Last updated April 7th, 2020

This notice may not be removed or altered from any source, binary or asset distribution.

This repo contains the source code for Anodyne, including all level, art, music, sound, and text content from the game.

The license contains two parts, pertaining to the source code assets, and then level/art/music/sound/text assets separately.



General Restrictions
----------

No resale or distribution of unaltered game

- You may not alter or redistribute any **unaltered** versions of this game  in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. This includes, but is not limited to, selling unaltered versions of this software, or including advertisements of any kind in unaltered versions of this software.  
- You may not redistribute the **unaltered** game for free.
- "Unaltered" means any version of the game where 90% of the average playtime contains significantly similar content to the original Anodyne (meaning you can't tint the sprite colors or change what Young looks like and call that an "altered" version.)

On mods

- Mods must contain wording somewhere (download page, title screen, credits) to indicate the mod is not the original Anodyne.
- As a general, non-legally-binding, guideline, 'small' mods (60 FPS, 'faster engine',  'funny filters') should be free. "Medium" mods (harder levels, remixed dungeons) should be free. "Large" mods (totally new level and world layouts, brand new dialogue) can be sold (even if it has no different art/music assets.) Because this is so legally grey I'm not enforcing this, but please be respectful and use your best judgment when it comes to charging money for mods.

Part 1: Anodyne Asset Library (Art, Level, Music, Sound, Text assets)
-------------

The Asset Library of Anodyne consists of mp3, wav, txt, csv, xml, png, etc files inside of bin/, mp3/, sfx/, src/xml, src/csv, src/res and src/data, as well as the .dam level data files.

Anodyne's Asset Library is free to be used for most purposes (commercial/noncommercial fangames, mods, etc), but:

The Asset Library for Anodyne falls under a CC BY 4.0 License (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) with the additional restrictions. For clarity (and to make explicit we are not claiming the asset library is under a CC license), the asset library does NOT fall under a "CC BY 4.0" license, but a mixture of the CC BY 4.0 terms and the following restrictions:


- To use these assets you must own a paid copy of Anodyne. This is only on the honor system though, so it's up to you to respect the request. I am choosing to include the assets here directly out of trust: most open or public sourced games make you copy the assets from an installed purchased version. As we still rely on Anodyne sales for our livelihood, please don't break this rule!
- The assets may not be used for commercial purposes for budgets over $100k USD: if your budget is over $100k you must contact us on a case-by-case basis to discuss licensing fees and royalties. This is mainly here to protect us against our work being used freely by extremely wealthy companies and the like - if you're a small solo developer or small team, we don't want to restrict you. 
- You may not use any of the assets in a way that would infringe upon the Anodyne game copyright by creating a product that may be mistaken for Anodyne (e.g. you may not compile the unaltered game and rename it "Andoyne" and sell it).
- You may not redistribute any of the unaltered assets in standlone packages, in a way primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. This includes but is not limited to: selling the art in 'asset packages', selling the music on music distribution platforms.
- You may not redistribute any of the unaltered assets for free without prior written permission (e.g., you may not create a "Anodyne Sprites" itch.io product page. Use your best judgment: if the edits you're making are not significantly different, you shouldn't redistribute it for free (e.g. tinting spritesheet slightly)). If you're not sure, please reach out to us and ask.
- Any COMMERCIAL, derivative work using these assets must include an acknowledgement visible to all users of the product (e.g. title screen of a game or game's store page) that it includes used assets that are copyright of Analgesic Productions LLC and are from the Anodyne asset library.
- The origin of these assets must not be misrepresented; you must not claim that you created the original assets.

Basically don't resell our stuff as if it was yours, and make sure to give credit where it's due!
